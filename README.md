# BankApp

This repository houses the backend implementation of a OTP (One-Time Password) system, designed to bolster the security of a banking application. Leveraging ASP.NET Core, the backend facilitates OTP generation and validation, ensuring secure user transactions. While the backend functionality is operational, the frontend integration, built with Angular, is a work in progress.
